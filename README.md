# Productivity-regression-of-garments-employees
Implementation of a regression algorithm to predict the productivity of the garment employees.

In this notebook I have exploited the statmodels package in order to analyze the relationship between predictors and response variable.
I have tested different machine learning algorithm, including a fully connected neural network.

The best result have been achieved by the Xgboost and Random forest regressor algorithms.
